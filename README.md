# Dioptra: Test Software for the Characterization of AI Technologies

The code is currently in a _pre-release_ status.
There is enough functionality to demonstrate the direction of the project, but the software is currently missing functionality that would provide a robust security model for deployment within an enterprise.

The project documentation is available at https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/.

## Building Documentation

To build the documentation locally, they are in the `docs` folder and compiled using Sphinx, make sure you have Docker installed and try to pull the builder images:

    make pull-latest-ci

If you do not have access to the project's Docker registry, then you can build and tag them manually:

    make build-ci tag-latest-ci

The documentation can then be built with,

    make docs

When the build is done, open `docs/build/index.html` in your web browser.
